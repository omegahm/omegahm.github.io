So today I got an early access for Githubs new [Atom editor](https://atom.io).
(Thanks [Kasper](https://twitter.com/kasperlewau)!)

I got to play around with it at work.
There are still loads to be done, but for a first beta-release it actually have a lot of nice features.

Github created a package manager (APM) besides Atom, to hold all the addons/plugins/packages that people would create.
To really give Atom a go, I tried implementing one.

Behold: [RubySyntaxReplace](https://github.com/omegahm/ruby-syntax-replacer) ([Atom link](https://atom.io/packages/ruby-syntax-replacer))

It does the exact same as my previous post about replacing old Ruby syntax with new, but now as a package I've created.
Have fun with it.
