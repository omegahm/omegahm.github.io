Earlier this year I got an e-mail from [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com) asking me if I was interested in reviewing a book about Heroku.

I have worked and deployed a couple of applications on Heroku, e.g. [KK400](http://kk400.herokuapp.com) (An accounting system for my old dormitory), [Sorteringsguide](http://www.sorteringsguide) and [Autobutler](http://www.autobutler.dk) (My old work), and their API, as well as some more fun applications, e.g. [event-bubbles](http://event-bubbles.herokuapp.com/), which show a bubble every time an event is fired in our system at [Lokalebasen.dk](http://www.lokalebasen.dk).

I of course said yes, and went on to read through Mike Coutermarsh's [Heroku Cookbook](http://bit.ly/1vLijZn) and giving it a technical review.

This is my first time doing reviews like this, however I loved reading through the book and getting a glimpse on the final version before it was actually released.

The book, which is available at [PacktPub](http://bit.ly/1vLijZn), will teach you to administer and deploy an Heroku application, as well as performance optimisation on the deployed application.
All in all 70 step-by-step recipes, which will guide you along the way of becoming a master at Heroku.

<small>Yes, yes I know... But I'm actually mentioned on page 3 in the free sample available on the [webpage](http://bit.ly/1vLijZn).</small>
