Back in August [I wrote](http://ohm.sh/2014/08/21/pull-requests.html) about a small application I'd written, which fetches organisation pull-requests.

I've now created a gem from that project, because I got asked by my co-workers how they could get their hands on it the easiest.

The code is open source and on [Github](https://github.com/omegahm/openpull) and you can get it yourself by doing:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install openpull
{% endhighlight %}

As written on Github, you'll need a `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` set in your environment.
To ease the use you can also set `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_ORGANISATION`, so you don't have to supply them to the command each time.

It'll print some coloured dots - a green for each repository in the organisation and a yellow for each open pull-request - and then print a table of all the open pull-requests with their current statuses.
